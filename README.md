# FreeBodies
Code for simulating the motion of a system of N free-bodies interacting with each-other in accordance to some power-law

# nBodySimulator.py
Contains several functions which can be used to simulate the motion of N free-bodies. These functions were used to simulate the motion of the free-bodies in our paper titled: "Ideas from bounded confidence theory applied to dynamical networks of interacting free-bodies" which was submitted for publication to the academic journal "Frontiers in Physics".

# SimulationScripts.py
Demonstrates another example of how these functions can be combined to extend research beyond the scope of the case-study in our paper.
